# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm **Hellasleeper**, a product-focused full-stack engineer who loves transforming bold ideas into polished, people-friendly experiences. I obsess over the little details—animations that feel right, copy that lands, flows that make sense—because those touches are what make software memorable.

## 🚀 What I'm Building
- **Side projects with heart:** Currently prototyping a minimalist habit tracker that uses storytelling to keep motivation high.
- **Friendly developer tools:** Experimenting with AI-assisted code reviews to help small teams keep quality high without slowing velocity.
- **Community experiments:** Running lightweight design jams with friends to explore how tech can make local communities feel closer.

## 🧰 Toolkit
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and a smattering of Rust when performance really matters.
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Astro, Flask, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel, Netlify, AWS (Lambda + DynamoDB), and Supabase.
- **Extras I adore:** Framer Motion for delightful interactions, Notion for knowledge gardening, and Figma for rapid prototyping.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- How to design humane AI copilots that feel collaborative instead of prescriptive.
- Techniques for rendering complex data visualizations in WebGL without melting laptops.
- Story-driven onboarding patterns that help users feel at home from their first click.

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate
I light up when building products that sit at the intersection of creativity and impact. If you're exploring:
